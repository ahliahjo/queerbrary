Queerbrary is all about LGBTQ+ inclusion and active support in library spaces, both for patrons and staff worldwide.

“But,” you may ask, “we already host Drag Queen Story Hour! Isn’t that enough?” First off, I love Drag Queen Story Hour. They’re amazing and deserve all the support in the world. They’re also a great entry into queer programming! But no, that’s not enough to support your LGBTQ+ patrons. Would one computer class a year be enough to support job hunters? One teen program? One crafting class? NO! Obviously we need to support our communities with lots of programs each year in order to meet their educational and social needs. Same should go for your LGBTQ+ population!

This blog is all about finding ways to meet the needs of your patrons (students, customers, etc.), staff, and faculty in a way that isn’t just lip service. Libraries of all kinds need comprehensive LGBTQ+ programming, collection development, outreach, and staff training and support in order to truly serve the community as a whole. And when we say comprehensive, we mean it – programming for all ages and abilities; collections that include Own Voices queer romance, sexual health, science fiction, biographies; collections that include equal representation of BIPOC queer authors; outreach that expands outside of the Pride parade; training that doesn’t focus solely on vocabulary.

There’s so much to explore when queering the library. Let’s get started.

## About Ahliah

Ahliah Jo Bratzler (she/her) is a former public librarian gone rogue. As an employee at the Indianapolis Public Library, Ahliah created a staff committee to address the lack of queer support in the system. She and her committee spearheaded the first LGBTQ+ programming in the system, acquired the historic Chris Gonzalez Collection (making her system the owner of the third largest public library collection of queer material in the country), and vastly expanded outreach to organizations in the community, particularly to Black and Brown organizations. She left public librarianship shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indiana to pursue freelance opportunities and to share her theories and praxis with libraries worldwide.

Ahliah is currently a Director-at-large of ALA’s Rainbow Round Table, but refuses to stay silent about ALA’s frequent failures to protect library workers, particularly during the pandemic. Ahliah is also an active participant of #LIBREV, and sees great hope for the future of libraries in that organization.

Ahliah identifies as a pansexual, disabled, radical librarian, and an intersectional feminist. She actively practices antiracism, though she knows it’s a lifelong journey where she’ll make many mistakes. She’s also an avid baker and crocheter.
