Most of these bills are aimed at transgender children – some strip away the right to medical interventions like puberty blockers, others prevent children and teens from playing in sports, and others still require teachers and administrators in our schools to out any child with \u0026ldquo;gender non-conforming habits\u0026rdquo;. These bills sponsor harm against transgender youth across the country in the name of a skewed, far-right morality that only allows for certain ways of being human. We know that preventing trans youth from coming out and living authentically leads to a rise in self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide, therefore these bills are direct attacks on the lives and livelihood of transgender and nonbinary youth. (Thankfully, during the writing of this, a bill in Florida requiring genital inspection of children thought to be transgender was defeated in legislature.) How can libraries help the trans youth who are the targets of state-sponsored violence?\nWhat can you do?\u003e\rWhat can you do? # I suggest that libraries, school and public specifically, should be on the forefront of this fight. While we should come out as institutions against the legislation, some of us are required by law to stay neutral in matters of politics. However, regardless of whether you can or cannot act politically, your library can and should become a bastion of safety for transgender youth (and adults, too, but we can talk about that later). Here are some ideas on how you can increase the safety of your space and hopefully help trans and nonbinary students feel welcome to be themselves.\nBuy as many positive representations of transgender and nonbinary people as possible within your budget – I’m talking physical books, e- and audiobooks, magazines, video, music, the posters you put up in the space, etc. Can’t buy anything? Provide coloring pages, make buttons for staff to wear, make book displays in pink, white, and blue (the colors of the trans flag). Don’t out your students. If you’re in a school district that requires you to out people, feign ignorance. You don’t know what they mean by gender non-compliance, and if they tell you what they mean, you just have never noticed it. Provide reference sheets digitally to student’s personal emails so there’s no paper in their hands or anything in their school profiles. Be welcoming to youth who are in the library just to hang out. They’re looking for a place to be themselves away from prying eyes. Provide that. Are you a public library worker? Be BOLD! Advocate for your library to form spaces for LGBTQ youth to meet up. Use your autonomy from the schools to promote books about trans youth. Hold book clubs with trans YA authors, stories, and characters, and make them open to youth of all genders. Make sure your adult section is not lacking in transgender resources! Ensure there are books about what transgender means, positive healthcare information, legal resources, etc. for the parents of trans kids. Whatever you do, we must band together as educators and library staff to provide the best service we can to transgender youth at all times, but especially in these times of politicization of children’s bodies. It’s our duty to do what we can to ensure they are loved, cared for, and informed.\nPhoto credit: Child running with a transgender flag during a Pride Parade in Portland, Maine.

Isn’t that enough?” First off, I love Drag Queen Story Hour. They’re amazing and deserve all the support in the world. They’re also a great entry into queer programming! But no, that’s not enough to support your LGBTQ+ patrons. Would one computer class a year be enough to support job hunters? One teen program? One crafting class? NO! Obviously we need to support our communities with lots of programs each year in order to meet their educational and social needs. Same should go for your LGBTQ+ population!\nThis blog is all about finding ways to meet the needs of your patrons (students, customers, etc.), staff, and faculty in a way that isn’t just lip service. Libraries of all kinds need comprehensive LGBTQ+ programming, collection development, outreach, and staff training and support in order to truly serve the community as a whole. And when we say comprehensive, we mean it – programming for all ages and abilities; collections that include Own Voices queer romance, sexual health, science fiction, biographies; collections that include equal representation of BIPOC queer authors; outreach that expands outside of the Pride parade; training that doesn’t focus solely on vocabulary.\nThere’s so much to explore when queering the library. Let’s get started.\nAbout Ahliah\u003e\rAbout Ahliah # Ahliah Jo Bratzler (she/her) is a former public librarian gone rogue. As an employee at the Indianapolis Public Library, Ahliah created a staff committee to address the lack of queer support in the system. She and her committee spearheaded the first LGBTQ+ programming in the system, acquired the historic Chris Gonzalez Collection (making her system the owner of the third largest public library collection of queer material in the country), and vastly expanded outreach to organizations in the community, particularly to Black and Brown organizations. She left public librarianship shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indiana to pursue freelance opportunities and to share her theories and praxis with libraries worldwide.\nAhliah is currently a Director-at-large of ALA’s Rainbow Round Table, but refuses to stay silent about ALA’s frequent failures to protect library workers, particularly during the pandemic. Ahliah is also an active participant of #LIBREV, and sees great hope for the future of libraries in that organization.\nAhliah identifies as a pansexual, disabled, radical librarian, and an intersectional feminist. She actively practices antiracism, though she knows it’s a lifelong journey where she’ll make many mistakes. She’s also an avid baker and crocheter.\n","date":"23 December 2020","permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Queerbrary!","summary":"Queerbrary is all about LGBTQ+ inclusion and active support in library spaces, both for patrons and staff worldwide.\n“But,” you may ask, “we already host Drag Queen Story Hour!
