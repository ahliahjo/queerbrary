For the past year and a half, you may have noticed that this blog has been silent, and this is the reason: I just couldn’t. I couldn’t handle the threats being thrown in the faces of LGBTQ+ people, LGBTQ+ children and teens especially. I couldn’t speak on the anti-intellectual attacks being brought in libraries across this country, attacking the very existence of queer and trans literature. I couldn’t allow myself to spend time on these because the void threatened to swallow me whole. I talk a big talk, but I’m not a fighter; and when things became dire, I mimicked a rabbit and scampered away to protect myself.\nThere’s no safety in my rabbit nest. My health, mentally and physically, isn’t protected by me staying silent - as a matter of fact, it’s likely significantly worse. Bottling it in instead of fighting helps no one; not me, not those I want to protect. So fuck that, let’s kick down some doors and scream.\nTHE SUPREME COURT vs. EVERYONE WHO ISN’T A WASP\u003e THE SUPREME COURT vs. EVERYONE WHO ISN’T A WASP # AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\u003e AFFIRMATIVE ACTION # This week has been a watershed moment for the Court, showing their true colors, so long as those colors are beige. Thursday, they effectively banned affirmative action, a program with a proven track record of increasing the likelihood of Black and brown college applicants getting accepted to their chosen school. It’s a stark reversal from the promises of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an assurance that not only would Black and brown people not be negatively targeted based on race, but that the government would institute policies to level the playing field and reduce the harms done over the centuries of enslavement and segregation.\nThe court\u0026rsquo;s decision is reprehensible. To quote Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:\nOur country has never been colorblind. Given the lengthy history of state-sponsored race-based preferences in America, to say that anyone is now victimized if a college considers whether that legacy of discrimination has unequally advantaged its applicants fails to acknowledge the well-documented ‘intergenerational transmission of inequality’ that still plagues our citizenry.\nI encourage you to read both Justice Jackson and Justice Sotomayor’s dissents to truly grasp the importance of affirmative action for college applications.\nDiversity doesn’t exist in a vacuum. This is bound to affect all of our Black and brown students, but if history tells us anything, it’s bound to affect those with multiple minority identities the hardest. Those who are racially diverse and LGBTQ+ (particularly trans kids) are certain to face more discrimination in the college admissions process due to this decision.\nSTUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT\u003e STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT # Speaking of disgusting decisions made by the Court, let’s talk about how they’ve abandoned former college students aged Gen X and younger to languish in debt for the rest of our lives. Just like most people, I went to college in order to get a career that could provide for myself and my family. Of course I was fed the typical lines of the 90s and 2000s - I should follow my heart when it came to what I study, a Bachelor’s degree was a certain way to ensure success in the marketplace, and the biggest lie of all, don’t worry about taking out student loans because you’ll be able to repay them once you have that nice cushy job. I signed my first student loan paperwork at 17 years old. Yep, I signed a binding contract with the federal government promising them I’d pay back every cent plus interest when I WASN’T EVEN AN ADULT YET. Yes, my parents had to cosign, but they weren’t highly educated (particularly not in finance), and they believed the hype just like I did.\nThere was a time where just getting a college degree was a guarantee of financial comfort, predominantly because very few people in the country pursued education above high school. As the Bachelor’s degree became an acceptable requirement for entry level office jobs in the late 2000s, a replacement for a high school diploma, they no longer promised economic freedom. While our wages may indeed be higher than those of a high school grad, wealth accumulation has dropped significantly, partially due to the high costs of student loan debt. Our hourly wages (or salaries, if we’re lucky) are frequently higher than high school grads, but our actual net income is functionally the same.\nSo we have millions of college grads who probably don’t have a career in their chosen field, who are being swallowed by debt owed to the federal government, often borrowed because of cultural promises that could not actually be attained. But we have millions more who are not college grads who also have student loan debt. 40% of all college students drop out at some point, with many of them never completing a degree. And of course, this disproportionately affects minorities - Black students are almost 34% more likely to drop out and disabled students are almost 60% more likely, only 25% of LGB women finish their degree, and transgender students are also much more likely to leave college early (data is much less available on transgender university outcomes than others, but work is being done to close that data gap). People with some college and no degree still have to pay back their student loans, but without the benefit of the increased income. Add to this the fact that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism all contribute to income inequality across all educational levels, and it’s obvious that minority groups will be the most affected by continued student loan debt.\nThe Court’s decision to not allow some student debt relief is unconscionable, as it will only serve to push those who are struggling underwater, particularly minority groups. We should not be forced to bear the weight of promises broken by the inaction of our government, especially when the loss of our student loan payments during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t topple the economy.\nOn a librarian side note - most librarians (public, school, academic, and special) have Master’s degrees. Library school is one of the only Master’s programs that does not offer graduate assistantships to pay for the program, so almost all of us had to take out additional student loans to become librarians. In my Midwestern state, in the capital city, public librarians start at $40k a year salary. Academic librarians make more on average, school librarians may make less, but we are all drowning in debt because we decided our skills would be best used serving you and your information needs. I hear some of you saying \u0026ldquo;but Ms. Librarian, what about the PSLF?\u0026rdquo; Public Service Loan Forgiveness still requires ten years of payment and full-time employment. Income-based payments are still a struggle when you make above the federal poverty line but below the true cost of living. Additionally, many librarians struggle to get full-time employment - this could be because library systems have limited positions and budgets, or because librarianship is extremely competitive (trying to get a full-time job in a city that has a library school can be nearly impossible), or because (librarianship being a low-earning job) they choose to work part-time to care for dependents. The PSLF is technically there, and does provide relief to some librarians, but it is not a cure-all. This additional relief could have been life-changing for librarians across the country.\nBUSINESSES CAN REFUSE SERVICE\u003e BUSINESSES CAN REFUSE SERVICE # This one’s the hardest for me to write. I’ve been sitting on my thoughts about this one for days, because it’s difficult to put into words how ridiculous this ruling is. People can now refuse service to LGBTQ+ people if the business sells items of creative speech. What is creative speech? Beats me, because the Court didn’t actually define it. The lack of definition means that any individualized services could easily not provide services to LGBTQ+ people, and provides precedent to potentially deny services to any protected class.\nObviously this is infuriating on many levels. The Court allowing discrimination on the basis of free speech is completely bonkers, and opens the doors to a cascade of lawsuits. But the thing that sticks out to me is that this case was based on a complete hypothetical - when Lorie Smith filed her suit, she had not even opened her wedding website business, and certainly had not been asked to create a gay wedding site. Instead of following the typical pattern of the law, she sued Colorado because there was a small possibility that she could be found to discriminate against queer people if she opened the business at all. I also can’t ignore that she is from the same town as the cake guy who brought a similar suit to the court last decade, and she used the same legal team. The only difference is her case chose to use the language of free speech instead of freedom of religion.\nAs Justice Sotomayor wrote in her dissent (joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson), “Today, the Court, for the first time in its history, grants a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of a protected class…the immediate, symbolic effect of the decision is to mark gays and lesbians for second-class status.” Businesses nationwide that create individualized products can now deny service to LGBTQ+ people because they don’t agree with the speech, but it’s astoundingly clear that this decision is a wedge that intentionally gives people the ability to discriminate against any protected class.\nTAKEAWAY\u003e TAKEAWAY # I wish I could say that there was a clear path forward with any of this, but I can\u0026rsquo;t. The only way out is through, so we need to keep living in this world and keep fighting the injustices, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to be hard. I can recommend that everyone join with local organizations striving to provide equal education, equal access, and debt relief. Investigate ways that you can fight back, no matter how large or small the effort. The only reason we had rights that they could strip away are because people fought for them in the first place. If we just sit and let things roll back, no one is going to make it right. We have to engage.\nPhoto credit and description: Photo of the sun setting on the Supreme Court.

Most of these bills are aimed at transgender children – some strip away the right to medical interventions like puberty blockers, others prevent children and teens from playing in sports, and others still require teachers and administrators in our schools to out any child with \u0026ldquo;gender non-conforming habits\u0026rdquo;. These bills sponsor harm against transgender youth across the country in the name of a skewed, far-right morality that only allows for certain ways of being human. We know that preventing trans youth from coming out and living authentically leads to a rise in self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide, therefore these bills are direct attacks on the lives and livelihood of transgender and nonbinary youth. (Thankfully, during the writing of this, a bill in Florida requiring genital inspection of children thought to be transgender was defeated in legislature.) How can libraries help the trans youth who are the targets of state-sponsored violence?\nWhat can you do?\u003e What can you do? # I suggest that libraries, school and public specifically, should be on the forefront of this fight. While we should come out as institutions against the legislation, some of us are required by law to stay neutral in matters of politics. However, regardless of whether you can or cannot act politically, your library can and should become a bastion of safety for transgender youth (and adults, too, but we can talk about that later). Here are some ideas on how you can increase the safety of your space and hopefully help trans and nonbinary students feel welcome to be themselves.\nBuy as many positive representations of transgender and nonbinary people as possible within your budget – I’m talking physical books, e- and audiobooks, magazines, video, music, the posters you put up in the space, etc. Can’t buy anything? Provide coloring pages, make buttons for staff to wear, make book displays in pink, white, and blue (the colors of the trans flag). Don’t out your students. If you’re in a school district that requires you to out people, feign ignorance. You don’t know what they mean by gender non-compliance, and if they tell you what they mean, you just have never noticed it. Provide reference sheets digitally to student’s personal emails so there’s no paper in their hands or anything in their school profiles. Be welcoming to youth who are in the library just to hang out. They’re looking for a place to be themselves away from prying eyes. Provide that. Are you a public library worker? Be BOLD! Advocate for your library to form spaces for LGBTQ youth to meet up. Use your autonomy from the schools to promote books about trans youth. Hold book clubs with trans YA authors, stories, and characters, and make them open to youth of all genders. Make sure your adult section is not lacking in transgender resources! Ensure there are books about what transgender means, positive healthcare information, legal resources, etc. for the parents of trans kids. Whatever you do, we must band together as educators and library staff to provide the best service we can to transgender youth at all times, but especially in these times of politicization of children’s bodies. It’s our duty to do what we can to ensure they are loved, cared for, and informed.\nPhoto description and credit: Child running with a transgender flag during a Pride Parade in Portland, Maine.

That’s GREAT! Congratulations to you for recognizing that there’s a need in your community for books written by queer authors and showcasing queer characters. Today I’m going to talk about some basic considerations you’ll want to take when improving your collection.\nWhy Are You Doing This?\u003e Why Are You Doing This? # Almost any reason for increasing LGBTQ+ titles is great in my book, because it leads to more information for the community. But your intention as the purchaser will influence what books get purchased, and therefore it’s important to evaluate your feelings toward the topic, your knowledge base, and what your intended outcome is. Are you doing this because your administration wants to seem “hip and with it”, or because you are an advocate for the queer community, or out of a feeling of responsibility due to patron requests? All of this will influence how you move forward and how much research you’ll need to put in.\nEnhance, ENHANCE\u003e Enhance, ENHANCE # My take is to enhance ALL THE SUBJECTS, but that’s not always possible in our budgets! You could pick areas willy-nilly, but what would be more equitable for your community is to evaluate how many books by/about queer people are in each subject area. This can be difficult, particularly since sexuality and gender identity is not frequently listed for authors, and also there are some subjects that don’t lend themselves to having queer content. However, I assure you that there are books from a queer lens in most Dewey categories, and they deserve to be included. My personal suggestion is to work from the subject that has the most room for improvement (few books currently, many available) to the one with the least.\nWeeding Isn\u0026rsquo;t Just For the Garden\u003e Weeding Isn\u0026rsquo;t Just For the Garden # While you’re enhancing, think about weeding, too! There are lots of books about the LGBTQ+ community that are outdated, if not harmful to the community. Unless a book has historical significance to your community, if it’s outdated, get rid of it! For example, my last library received a very large donation of queer materials, with a chunk that were about the medical perspectives of HIV/AIDS from the 1990s. Obviously, our medical knowledge about HIV/AIDS has increased dramatically, and our treatment options have also expanded (see PEP and PrEP), so keeping these books on the shelf would be poor stewardship of the collection. Another example would be books that promote conversion therapy. These books are not just harmful to the community, but the methods they recommend can increase the chances of suicide or suicide attempts in LGBTQ+ people. If you wouldn’t keep a book teaching people to cook with arsenic, you should not have books that instruct parents on the “positives” of conversion therapy.\nDiscover Zone\u003e Discover Zone # Lastly, I want you to think about discoverability. How are people going to find these books? I always recommend against any sort of outward indicator — stickers, special sections, etc. — as these can stigmatize and possibly out patrons who wish to check them out. We want to ensure that kids and teens, especially, can check out books without a huge neon sign outing them to their parents. So you can improve discoverability in other ways. Does your catalog have a tagging system (not headings, but user-created tags)? You can add plain language tags that patrons might search (I use homosaurus.org to find natural language descriptors when I’m stuck). Also, make sure that every display, and I mean EVERY, has a queer book on it. Display about space? Biography of Sally Ride, first lesbian in space. Display of cookbooks? Add a queer cookbook author to it (there are plenty to choose from!). We are everywhere, so our books should be everywhere too. This will not only improve discoverability for patrons, but it will also normalize queer existence in your library.\nI’ll be posting more advanced collection ideas in the future, but for now, HAPPY BUILDING!\nPhoto description and credit: Person with long hair and yellow sweater searching through a rainbow shelf of books.

Isn’t that enough?” First off, I love Drag Queen Story Hour. They’re amazing and deserve all the support in the world. They’re also a great entry into queer programming! But no, that’s not enough to support your LGBTQ+ patrons. Would one computer class a year be enough to support job hunters? One teen program? One crafting class? NO! Obviously we need to support our communities with lots of programs each year in order to meet their educational and social needs. Same should go for your LGBTQ+ population.\nThis blog is all about finding ways to meet the needs of your patrons (students, customers, etc.), staff, and faculty in a way that isn’t just lip service. Libraries of all kinds need comprehensive LGBTQ+ programming, collection development, outreach, and staff training and support in order to truly serve the community as a whole. And when we say comprehensive, we mean it – programming for all ages and abilities; collections that include queer romance, sexual health, science fiction, biographies; collections that include equal representation of BIPOC queer authors; outreach that expands outside of the Pride parade; training that doesn’t focus solely on vocabulary.\nThere’s so much to explore when queering the library. Let’s get started.\nAbout Ahliah\u003e About Ahliah # Ahliah Jo Bratzler (she/they) is a former public librarian gone rogue. As an employee at the Indianapolis Public Library, Ahliah created a staff committee to address the lack of queer support in the system. She and her committee spearheaded the first LGBTQ+ programming in the system, acquired the historic Chris Gonzalez Collection (making her system the owner of the third largest public library collection of queer material in the country), and vastly expanded outreach to organizations in the community, particularly to Black and Brown organizations. She left public librarianship shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indiana to pursue freelance opportunities and to share her theories and praxis with libraries worldwide. They currently work with the Stonewall Book Awards as the administrator for the Barbara Gittings Literature Award committee.\n","date":"23 December 2020","permalink":"/about/","section":"Queerbrary","summary":"Queerbrary is all about LGBTQ+ inclusion and active support in library spaces, both for patrons and staff worldwide.\n“But,” you may ask, “we already host Drag Queen Story Hour!

We gain new patrons by connecting to underserved populations, listening to their needs, and either a) connecting them to services we have that meet that need or b) adding services in order to be more useful to them. If you’re on this page, I’m going to guess that your library (or system, consortium, what have you) has yet to make a connection to the LGBTQ+ community. Or maybe you have, but it begins and ends with driving the bookmobile in the Pride parade. Parades are a good thing to participate in, but they’re simply lip service without the outreach and services to back up your activism.\nInstitutional Support\u003e Institutional Support # First, I recommend getting support from your library. Outreach is useless if you don’t have buy-in from collections or programming to provide services to your new demographic. Administrators may or may not be on board, and some might find outreach to queer communities to be a liability. How do you convince them that the LGBTQ+ community is worth the effort of an outreach campaign? That’ll vary wildly depending on where you are – a big library system with lots of resources will likely be more open to it than a small, one branch library with limited (or overstretched) staffing. Either way, be prepared for a heated discussion. Bigotry exists everywhere. Come to the table with statistics and your passion for the queer community.\nFinding Community Partners\u003e Finding Community Partners # Once armed with institutional support, it’s time to reach out to the community! But…how does one do that? You’ll need to find an organization or two to start. Most larger cities and counties have Pride organizations, which are usually the most organized queer presence in the area they inhabit. There are also typically a couple of organizations focused on smaller segments of the LGBTQ+ community writ large, like a BIPOC group, a youth program, a homeless shelter for LGBTQ+ individuals, an AIDS organization. If you’re not in a city, I actually recommend going to Twitter or Instagram and searching LGBTQ+ [your town/county name here]. You might find some small organizations or meetups that address the needs of queer individuals. Regardless of area, I especially recommend reaching out to the more underserved populations within queer spaces, otherwise you run the risk of solely helping the LGBTQ+ people who need the least help.\nNow, you need to reach out! You could send an email, but that’s unlikely to be met with enthusiasm from the organization you’ve contacted. Your best bet for making contact is to go to one of their events! Have fun, meet people, and try to find a representative for the group. Bring a business card and let them know you are going to reach out. THEN you can email them. Lots of queer organizations are holding online events, so please consider attending one of those during our plague-filled times. In the email, you should set up another meeting so that you can discuss what their community needs. They probably will not know why you want to meet with them. Be honest! Tell them how you know that the library isn’t providing services that directly help the queer community right now, and that you want to make it right. Tell them your ideas for things that might help, and listen to their responses! They might love your ideas, they might find them stupid. If so, ask what they think would be better.\nThe ultimate goal is to form a partnership. If you can find a way to have a joint program in the future, or to work on grants for queer collection funding, or if you can represent the library at their career festival, DO IT! If it’s your goal to get more queer people into the building to use your services, you want to do it with a name they trust. That’s the quickest and smoothest way to create services that will be used and loved.\nDo you have tips, tricks, or success stories you’d like to share? Comment below! I’d love to see what’s worked for others.\nPhoto description and credit: People walking across a rainbow crosswalk.

We\u0026rsquo;re obsessed with words and their meanings. So much of our work is searching, and we are taught and trained on how to make words work for us. Categorization is our bread and butter \u0026ndash; therefore it makes sense (to some degree) that, when faced with a new subject, our first instinct is to learn the vocab. I suggest that this instinct, particularly when aimed at LGBTQ+ staff training, hinders our work, and that there are more effective ways to use our training time.\nThe Training (dun dun)\u003e The Training (dun dun) # In my experience, there is one kind of training geared towards LGBTQ+ topics that library systems are willing to tackle \u0026ndash; a vocabulary training. It\u0026rsquo;s comfortable, it helps library staff understand terms that might be used, but does it actually help us work with queer patrons? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. The vocab trainings (yes, plural) that I\u0026rsquo;ve attended are long, boring readings of dictionary definitions, often hosted by a cis, straight trainer that has no connection to the vocab or the culture it\u0026rsquo;s meant to represent. Sometimes we get even less than that, perhaps one sheet of vocab handed out during a general \u0026ldquo;diversity\u0026rdquo; training. But who is this vocab helping? We\u0026rsquo;re trained information professionals, surely if someone asks for a book with an asexual protagonist, we could look that up! As a matter of fact, I suggest you bookmark this site of queer vocabulary (compiled by many awesome librarians, archivists, academics, and historians) and ignore any future training that just focuses on vocabulary. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth your time, and it\u0026rsquo;s not helping anyone become a better ally.\nI get why we go for the vocab training. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for our staff trainer, state organizations, invited diversity speaker, etc. to learn quickly and be able to share. It\u0026rsquo;s not time-intensive, but it has very little value for your time.\nSo\u0026hellip; what would be (more) useful?\u003e So\u0026hellip; what would be (more) useful? # Budgets are stretched to the brink, so why waste time on trainings that can easily be covered by a web search? It would be a much better value to train staff on topics that will improve the quality of the library experience for both patron and staff alike.\nAllyship in the Library\u003e Allyship in the Library # This is a basic training that gets a lot of bang for its buck. Topics covered in an allyship training involve (but aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to):\nAlways model queer-affirming behavior, regardless of your assumptions about a patron\u0026rsquo;s sexuality or gender identity. This includes asking for pronouns, wearing your pronoun on a button (yes this really helps!), not assuming what bathroom a person needs, calling out anti-LGBTQ+ behavior from patrons or colleagues, using gender-inclusive language, and much more. Have inclusive book displays, book lists, and programs. Please stop reserving queer books for Pride displays \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;re queer all year! Partnering with LGBTQ+ groups How to identify that someone\u0026rsquo;s signalling that they need queer recommendations :arrow_ left: this is where queer vocabulary comes in handy You don\u0026rsquo;t have to go super in-depth with any of these sections in an allyship training \u0026ndash; like I said, this is a BASIC training. Provide resources for staff so they can do deeper dives (there are lots of resources on GLSEN, The Trevor Project, and ALA\u0026rsquo;s Rainbow Round Table), and I highly recommend getting buttons so people can display their willingness to help LGBTQ+ patrons. Identity flags and pronoun buttons would be ideal.\nQueer Programming\u003e Queer Programming # This is exactly what it sounds like \u0026ndash; how and why to host queer programming, with a brainstorming session for programming ideas. This type of training could be generalized or localized to your geographic area. I recommend covering the demographic needs of your LGBTQ+ population; in Indiana, for example, LGBTQ+ people are likely to work in lower-income jobs due to discrimination, are still often ostracized from family at a younger age, and we often face worse health outcomes due to discrimination and income inequality. The demographic needs of your area will help you discover programming that could be useful to lots of people, but particularly to your queer population \u0026ndash; things like resume workshops, free entertainment options (like a movie club or book club), and health classes would be useful given the particular needs of my community. This training could also cover how to advertise to a queer population\nReader\u0026rsquo;s Advisory\u003e Reader\u0026rsquo;s Advisory # This training would go into further depth about how to provide reader\u0026rsquo;s advisory for queer readers. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to know all the terms to be able to provide this service, but it is definitely more advanced than \u0026ldquo;be a good ally\u0026rdquo;. Knowing that patrons might feel shy asking you about a gay romance (which some straight patrons are shy about romance too!) and might dance around the topic, or that they might wish to be more self-guided out of fear of discrimination is useful. Passive and active reader\u0026rsquo;s advisory would ideally be covered, like making book displays and book lists that always involve queer content to knowing the top Own Lives authors.\nSensitivity Training\u003e Sensitivity Training # What do you do if you have staff that are resistant to help LGBTQ+ patrons? If you have staff who are disrespectful to co-workers that are queer? Well, it might be time to send them to sensitivity training. I highly recommend being proactive when discrimination is noticed \u0026ndash; yes, the staff member might usually be great with all patrons, but one instance of queer discrimination will spread and foster a negative reaction in the community, and could cause staff discord. There are lots of organizations around the United States that hold sensitivity trainings (in Indiana, Indiana Youth Group holds a few each year), and they\u0026rsquo;re super at helping staff move back to neutral or positive regarding LGBTQ+ people.\nFinal Thoughts\u003e Final Thoughts # There\u0026rsquo;s so much to write about staff training when it comes to queering the library, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. My best beginner\u0026rsquo;s advice is please, don\u0026rsquo;t give in to the simplicity of a vocabulary training. It bores staff and does so little for your patrons. Think past the vocab sheet, get a little creative, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to get messy. Inclusion initiatives will directly conflict with the worldview of some of your staff, so mess is almost guaranteed, but I promise you it\u0026rsquo;s worth it.\nPhoto description and credit: A brick wall with a crossword painted on it.

I bet you’re wondering, “what is a queerbrary?” It’s a portmanteau, a combination of two words to make a new, fun word! It’s also this website. Here, I’ll be writing about queer library topics — from trending topics like trans bathroom laws and J.K. Rowling’s transphobia, to theory and praxis regarding outreach to queer organizations, collection management, programming for all ages and all library types, and staff training and support. There will also be book reviews, predominantly Own Lives (though I won’t shy away from tearing apart That New Trending Book by a White Woman that Ignores Our Reality).\nYep, it’s a whole thing. And we’ll get into it all.\nBut who am I to talk about this? I’m a public librarian focused on active queer inclusion in libraries. I’ve made it my mission to ensure that libraries don’t just do the bare minimum when it comes to acknowledging LGBTQ+ patrons. A booth at your local Pride celebration, walking in the parade, and having a Drag Queen Story Hour are nowhere near enough to serve your queer patrons. They’re great entry points, but if they’re all you do, you’re tokenizing your LGBTQ+ population for “woke” points. As a pansexual person myself, I’ve felt excluded from libraries for decades — the books and the programs aren’t aimed at me, and the library staff were often untrained on how to answer my questions (and sometimes, in rural Indiana, downright rude and mean). I know firsthand the passive and active discrimination taking place in our libraries, and I am passionate about moving the needle towards justice.\nI’m also a trained sex educator, specifically trained in holistic sex-positive education and whole life sex education, and theorganizer for Indy Pride’s young adult meetup. In these two positions, I work with young adults to create a welcoming environment where all questions are welcome and all people celebrated. These are missing from the library environment, and I want to find ways to incorporate this knowledge and experience into the library writ large.\nQueer library work is useless if we don’t also look at the intersections of race, class, gender, and disability. I believe Black Lives Matter, and I believe that Black Trans Lives Matter, and that until we accept our internalized racism and work to become anti-racist, we will not be able to grow as LGBTQ+ organizers. I don’t promise I’ll always get it right. I’m a white cisgendered woman, and might make mistakes regarding race and gender. What I do promise you is that I welcome constructive criticism, and will correct myself as I grow and learn.\nStick around. We’ll have fun here.\nPhoto description and credit: Brightly-colored wall mural. On the left side is a speech bubble containing the phrase \u0026ldquo;Hello!\u0026rdquo;.
